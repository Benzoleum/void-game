# void-game
A little text-based game 

A little text-based game I did as a final project for the introduction to Python class. That was my first experience making any kind of game really. 

The game is about a person caught in outer space by passerby cargo ship members, drifting in space unconscious. This character has lost his memory and it's up to you to uncover what has happened to that person. The story is not finished yet, but I am planning on finishing the game in the near future.
